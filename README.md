# Library Management System (OOP Java)

A comprehensive Java library management system demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming concepts including **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

## üìã Features

- **Book Management**: Add, view, and manage book inventory
- **Member Management**: Handle different types of library members (Students, Faculty)
- **Transaction System**: Track book borrowing and returning
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **OOP Implementation**: Demonstrates all three pillars of OOP

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & OOP Concepts

### Encapsulation
- **Book Class**: Private fields with public getters/setters
- **Member Class**: Protected fields for inheritance
- **Transaction Class**: Private transaction details with controlled access

### Inheritance
- **Member** (Abstract base class)
  - **Student** (extends Member)
  - **Faculty** (extends Member)

### Polymorphism
- Abstract method `getDisplayInfo()` implemented differently by Student and Faculty
- Runtime method binding for member-specific display information

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command line terminal

### Step 1: Compile the Java Files

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd library-management-oop-java

# Compile all Java files
javac *.java
```

### Step 2: Run the Application

## üîß Key Classes Overview

### Library.java
- **Main application class**
- Contains the user interface and core business logic
- Manages collections of books, members, and transactions
- Demonstrates composition and aggregation

### Book.java
- **Encapsulation example**
- Private fields: bookId, title, author, category, available
- Public getters and setters for controlled access
- toString() method for object representation

### Member.java (Abstract)
- **Inheritance base class**
- Protected fields accessible by subclasses
- Abstract method `getDisplayInfo()` for polymorphism
- Common member properties and methods

### Student.java & Faculty.java
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism examples**
- Extend the Member class
- Override `getDisplayInfo()` with class-specific implementations
- Additional properties specific to each member type

### Transaction.java
- **Transaction tracking system**
- Uses UUID for unique transaction IDs
- LocalDateTime for timestamp management
- Formatted output for transaction history

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

1. **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and controlled access through getters/setters
2. **Inheritance**: Code reuse through class hierarchies (Member ‚Üí Student/Faculty)
3. **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and runtime method binding
4. **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and methods
5. **Composition**: Library "has-a" relationship with Books, Members, Transactions
6. **Java Collections**: ArrayList usage for dynamic data management
7. **Exception Handling**: Basic error handling and validation
8. **Date/Time Handling**: Modern Java time API usage

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Compilation Errors
- Ensure all Java files are in the same directory
- Check Java version: `java -version`
- Verify JAVA_PATH environment variable

### Runtime Issues
- Make sure all .class files are generated after compilation
- Run from the correct directory containing compiled classes
